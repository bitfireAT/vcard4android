/**
 * Represents a "cached group membership" row. Cached group memberships exist only
 * for one reason, which _only_ applies to the vCard4 (KIND/MEMBER) group method:
 *
 * Every group has its list of members. When a contact's group memberships are changed,
 * the contact is automatically set to dirty, but the group itself is not!
 *
 * So we keep a copy of all group membership rows as "cached memberships". At the
 * beginning of every sync, the group memberships of every contact are compared with
 * its cached group memberships. If they differ, the respective contact group
 * is set to dirty (because its memberships have changed).
 *
 * Cached group memberships must not be used for anything else that detecting dirty groups.
