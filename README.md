# vcard4android

vcard4android is an Android library that brings together VCard and Android.
It's a framework for

* parsing and generating VCard resources (using [ez-vcard](https://github.com/mangstadt/ez-vcard))
  from/into data classes that are compatible with the Android Contacts Provider, and
* accessing the Android Contacts Provider by a unified API.

It has been primarily developed for [DAVx⁵](https://www.davx5.com).

To view the available gradle tasks for the library: `./gradlew vcard4android:tasks`
(the `vcard4android` module is defined in `settings.gradle`).
